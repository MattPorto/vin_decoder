# VIN Decoder
A simple VIN decoder to practice my Ruby alone skills.

Based on https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/decoder

## Dependencies
* Ruby: `>= 2.7.0`

## Running
To run the application, just go to root folder and run `ruby index.rb {VIN_NUMBER}`.

## Testing
This scripts use Unit Test as Test Suite (because it already comes with Ruby standard library).

To run all test cases, just run `rake test`.
